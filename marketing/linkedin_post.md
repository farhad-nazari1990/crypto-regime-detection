# 🚀 Crypto Regime Detection using Machine Learning

I'm excited to share my latest project: **Automated Regime Detection for Bitcoin** using advanced Machine Learning techniques!

## 🎯 What it does:

This production-ready pipeline automatically identifies different market regimes in BTC-USD trading data:

✅ **Low Volatility Bull** - Steady uptrends with minimal risk
✅ **High Volatility Rally** - Strong gains with elevated risk
✅ **Consolidation** - Sideways movement and accumulation phases
✅ **Panic/Crash** - Sharp declines with extreme volatility

## 🔬 Technical Approach:

🧠 **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** - Captures temporal dynamics and state persistence
📊 **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** - Baseline clustering for comparison
📈 **Change Point Detection** - Identifies structural breaks using Ruptures algorithm

## 💡 Key Features:

- 10+ engineered features (volatility, momentum, RSI, Bollinger Bands)
- Automated pipeline with single-command execution
- Comprehensive performance metrics (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown)
- Beautiful visualizations with regime-colored price charts
- Full model comparison and validation

## 📊 Results:

The system successfully detected major market transitions including:
- 2017 bull run peak
- 2018 bear market
- 2020 COVID crash and recovery
- 2021 all-time highs
- 2022 bear market

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:

Python | scikit-learn | hmmlearn | ruptures | pandas | matplotlib | seaborn

## 🎓 Applications:

✨ Risk management and position sizing
✨ Algorithmic trading strategy optimization
✨ Portfolio rebalancing triggers
✨ Market sentiment analysis
